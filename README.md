# Mobile Pricing

By Beverly Huang

## Motivation and Goal
Pricing is the most powerful P&L lever for the retailer. No matter you are creating a new product or starting a new business, you need to think about how to price your product smartly. Especially in a competitive market, pricing is a tool to differentiate yourself from your competitors and get the market share. To price your product, your first step is to understand competitors’ pricing strategies. Thus, this project will use mobile phone market as an example to illustrate the method we can use for pricing.

## Conclusion
This project uses mobile phone market as an example to illustrate how to use competitors’ pricing information to build a pricing model for your products. A KNN model is built based on the best K we find from both testing accuracy and GridSearch cross validation result. This model achieves 93.17% accuracy. With this model, the sales team can price mobile phones based on their features easily. This pricing model can also be implemented in other products and industries. It is a pricing model that incorporates both value-based pricing (which considers product value) and competitive pricing (which considers competitors’ pricing). Thus, it is a good model for new product pricing.
